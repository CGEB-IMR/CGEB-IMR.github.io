							<h2>Protocols</h2>
						</header>
						<section>
							<p>The following protocol summaries are for the generation of paired-end sequencing reads of 16S or 18S PCR amplicons with multiple barcodes (ie: "indices") on the Illumina MiSeq 
							machine of length approx. 400-500 bp (300+300 bp with ~100-200 bp overlap). It assumes an input of up to 384 (380 samples + 4 PCR controls). These protocols are a synthesis of multiple 
							sources in the current scientific literature, but draws upon some of the following sources:
							<ul class="default">

								<a name="collect"></a><h3>Sample Collection</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Sample collection issues can be very specific to your sample type (ie: the medium which you are sampling) - many of our IMR projects so far focus on water column "environmental" 
							samples or fecal matter. For the former, varying volumes of water are typically collected onto filters and frozen at -20&deg;C or -80&deg;C in a storage buffer. For the latter, fresh fecal 
							pellets are collected from mice or human stool is sampled and then frozen immediately at -20&deg;C or -80&deg;C (without buffer). All samples are kept frozen until extraction below.
							</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<header>
								<a name="extract"></a><h3>DNA/RNA Extraction</h3>
							</header>
							<p>DNA/RNA is extracted from the samples using the method/kit appropriate to the specific samples - this may also be a choice you make for your personal samples since you have experience 
							with them, or you may wish to follow our choice extraction methods. There is no general consensus in the literature on choice of kits, other than to say all of them affect the 
							final profiles to some degree and that bead-beating is most probably a must for difficult materials (and/or with much Gram+ves and protist cysts) - we have currently evaluated and
							are using the <b>MO BIO PowerFecal DNA Kit</b> with mouse pellets and human fecal samples. We are also testing various DNA kits for use with human urine. We have not yet ventured into 
							RNA kits for metatranscriptomes, but this is something that we will be examining in the near future. Quantification and quality-checks are done (via NanoDrop or PicoGreen/Qubit) to 
							verify success. <i>Optional: A gel can be run to verify integrity (generally unnecessary for PCR-only studies, but required for shotgun metagenomic sequencing).</i>

							<p>16S fragments are PCR-amplified from the DNA in duplicate using separate template dilutions (generally 1:1 & 1:10) using the high-fidelity <b>Phusion</b> 
							polymerase. A single round of PCR is done using "fusion primers" (Illumina adaptors + indices + specific regions) targeting the <b>V6/V7/V8 region</b> (438/446 bp usable sequence for Bacteria/Archaea) with 
							multiplexing which allows up to 384 samples to be run. We are currently also evaluating <b>V4/V5 primers</b> as an option for our service and they may soon be available. PCR products are verified visually by running a high-throughput <b>Invitrogen 96-well E-gel</b>. Any samples with 
							failed PCRs (or spurious bands) are re-amplified by optimizing PCR conditions to produce correct bands in order to complete the sample plate before continuing. The PCR reactions 
							from the same samples are pooled in one plate, then cleaned-up and normalized using the high-throughput <b>Invitrogen SequalPrep 96-well Plate Kit</b>. The (up to) 384 samples are 
							then pooled to make one library which is then quantified and quality-checked as above before sequencing.

							<p>18S fragments are PCR-amplified from the DNA in duplicate using separate template dilutions (generally 1:1 & 1:10) using the high-fidelity <b>Phusion</b> 
							polymerase. A single round of PCR is done using "fusion primers" (Illumina adaptors + indices + specific regions) targeting the <b>V4 region</b> (typically 438 bp useable sequence, but some organisms have indels) with 
							multiplexing which allows up to 384 samples to be run. In cases where human or mouse 18S DNA contamination will be of great concern, a <b>mammalian blocking primer</b> is 
							used following the protocol from the EMP listed above. PCR products are verified visually by running a high-throughput <b>Invitrogen 96-well E-gel</b>. Any samples with 
							failed PCRs (or spurious bands) are re-amplified by optimizing PCR conditions to produce correct bands in order to complete the sample plate before continuing. The PCR	reactions 
							from the same samples are pooled in one plate, then cleaned-up and normalized using the high-throughput <b>Invitrogen SequalPrep 96-well Plate Kit</b>. The (up to) 384 samples are

							<p>Microbial (or mtDNA) genomes and community metagenomes are prepared using the <b>Illumina Nextera XT</b> kit which requires a very small amount of starting material (1 ng) as it 
							is a PCR-based library preparation procedure. Briefly, samples are "tagmented" (enzymatically "sheared" and tagged with adaptors), PCR amplified while adding barcodes, purified 
							using columns, normalized using Illumina beads or manually, then pooled for loading onto the MiSeq or NextSeq.

							<p>We are currently in the process of evaluating <b>Illumina (Ribo-Zero + TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT)</b> vs. <b>NuGEN (Ovation Complete Prokaryotic RNA-Seq)</b> kits for the production of 
							sufficiently rRNA-depleted libraries for RNA-Seq. Briefly, after rRNA depletion, remaining mRNAs are converted to cDNA in a way that maintains stranded information, tagged with 
							adaptors+barcodes, PCR amplified, purified using columns, normalized using beads or manually, then pooled for loading onto the MiSeq or NextSeq.

							</header>
							<p>
								Amplicon samples, small metagenomic sets, and small genomes are run on our <b>Illumina MiSeq</b> using 300+300 bp paired-end V3 chemistry which	allows for overlap and 
								stitching togther of paired amplicon reads into one full-length read of higher quality. Output is generally ~25 million raw reads and ~15 Gb of sequence = ~80,000 reads per 
								sample for 384 amplicons. For larger metagenomic/metatranscriptomic projects, we run on our recently-acquired <b>Illumina NextSeq 550</b> using 150+150 bp paired-end "high 
								output" chemistry generating up to ~400 million raw reads and ~120 Gb of sequence.
